# Phase 5: Large Scale Universe - Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Build multi-world architecture, DAO governance, cross-world connections, and complete ecosystem

**Architecture:**
- Multi-World System: Multiple universes with different rules
- DAO Governance: Decentralized autonomous organization
- Cross-World Connections: Portals and bridges between worlds
- Extended Creator Economy: Advanced revenue models
- Complete Ecosystem: Integration of all phases

## Task 1: Multi-World Architecture

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/multiverse/__init__.py`
- Create: `backend/multiverse/world.py`
- Create: `backend/multiverse/portal.py`
- Create: `tests/test_multiverse.py`

**Features:**
- Multiple independent worlds
- World rules and physics
- World-scale management
- Multi-layer hierarchy (multiverse → universe → world → region)

## Task 5: Ecosystem Integration

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/ecosystem/__init__.py`
- Create: `backend/ecosystem/orchestrator.py`
- Create: `backend/ecosystem/events.py`
- Create: `tests/test_ecosystem.py`

**Features:**
- Cross-phase integration
- Event bus system
- Plugin architecture
- Developer API
- Analytics and monitoring

---

## Execution Order

1. Task 1: Multi-World Architecture (foundation)
2. Task 2: DAO Governance (governance)
3. Task 3: Cross-World Connections (connectivity)
4. Task 4: Extended Creator Economy (incentives)
5. Task 5: Ecosystem Integration (integration)

---

**Success Criteria:**
- All tasks implemented with modular architecture
- Multi-world hierarchy working
- DAO governance functional
- Cross-world portals operational
- Extended economy integrated
- Complete ecosystem with all phases working together

**Ready for execution!**
